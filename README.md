### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered.  The seed file in [`prisma/seed.js`](./prisma/seed.js) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.


### 3. Start the REST API server

```
npm run dev
```

The server is now running on `http://localhost:3000`. You can send the API requests implemented in `index.js`, e.g. [`http://localhost:3000/feed`](http://localhost:3000/feed).
